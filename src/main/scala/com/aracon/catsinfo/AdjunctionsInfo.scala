  // Adjunctions are among the most important constructions in mathematics.
  // - First, every fundamental datatype— sums, products, function types, recursive types—arises out of an adjunction.
  //   The defining properties of an adjunction give rise to well-known laws of the algebra of programming.
  // - Second, adjunctions are instrumental in unifying and generalising recursion schemes.

  // They are present on many structures, as can be seen at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h60VMBPfLoM
  // But currently it seems to be more of a theoretical foundation that helps generating other constructions
  // than a typeclass we can directly apply.
  //
  // Even if we would us Adjunctions to build, for example, our own State monads, it would be much less performant than
  // the State monad implementations we currently use. So, good for lawfulness, theoretical basis of constructs, but
  // not really applicable right now.
